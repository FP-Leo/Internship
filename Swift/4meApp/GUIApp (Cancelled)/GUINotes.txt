Completed:
1. Log in Screen (two templates)
2. Main Screen ( design can change )
3. New Request Screen designs ( two to choose from, after that one will get deleted )
4. Show Request Screen design
5. Service Instance Screen

To be implemented:
1. Log in security and logic. // Medium
2. Navigation Bar functions ( log out from the gear, view profile from the person icon). // Easy
3. ConfigurationItemsScreen // Easy
4. Connect the app using the actual API not personal API tokens. // Hard
5. Send request using API. // Easy after step 3 or using personal tokens
6. View your requests using the API // Easy after step 3, already done using personal API tokens
7. Customize colors for dark mode. // Easy

Alterantive to connecting the whole app with the APi would be to force every user to use their own personal API tokens but that is not user friendly.
